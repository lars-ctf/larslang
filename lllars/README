low level lars (lllars)

low level lars is the best programming to exsist, there will never be a better language (excluding high level lars of course).

!!! Documentation !!!

Files should start with

"!!! all rights reserved to lars <3 !!!"

Everything else should be intuitive (espacially for lars)

!!! Technical Details !!!
lll is very good language thats why it uses two programming language (because two is better than one). `parser.hs` parses a file:

$ runhaskell parser.hs lars.lll > input.json

and outputs an ast to `input.json`. Don't be shy, take a look at this piece of a(s/r)t.

llltranspiler, transpiles the ast to a blazing fast low level intermediate language:

$ java -jar llltranspiler/llltranspiler-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar


to run the programming

$ cc out.c && ./a.out
